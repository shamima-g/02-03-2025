# Claude Code Agents

This directory contains specialized Claude Code agents that support a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow for building features in this template repository.

## TDD Workflow Overview

```
INTAKE (once) → DESIGN (once) → SCOPE (epics only) → [STORIES → [REALIGN → WRITE-TESTS → IMPLEMENT → QA] per story] per epic
```

**Expanded view:**
```
[intake-agent] → [intake-brd-review-agent] → [design-api-agent] → [design-style-agent] → [design-wireframe-agent] → feature-planner → feature-planner → feature-planner → test-generator → developer → code-reviewer
              INTAKE                                              DESIGN (conditional per manifest)                  SCOPE             STORIES           REALIGN          WRITE-TESTS     IMPLEMENT      QA
          (2 agents, once)                                      (up to 3 agents, mandatory, once)                  (all epics)        (per epic)        (per story)       (per story)     (per story)   (per story)
```

| Phase | Agent | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **INTAKE** | intake-agent | Onboarding routing (share docs, prototype import, or guided Q&A), scan docs, gather basics, produce intake manifest (once) |
| **INTAKE** | intake-brd-review-agent | Review requirements completeness, produce FRS (once) |
| **DESIGN** | design-api-agent | Generate OpenAPI spec from feature requirements (conditional per manifest) |
| **DESIGN** | design-style-agent | Generate CSS design tokens and style reference guide (conditional per manifest) |
| **DESIGN** | design-wireframe-agent | Generate text-based wireframes for UI screens (conditional per manifest) |
| **SCOPE** | feature-planner | Define ALL epics upfront (no stories yet) |
| **STORIES** | feature-planner | Define stories for the current epic only |
| **REALIGN** | feature-planner | Revise upcoming story based on discovered impacts (per story) |
| **WRITE-TESTS** | test-generator | Write failing tests before implementation (per story) |
| **IMPLEMENT** | developer | Implement code to make tests pass (per story) |
| **QA** | code-reviewer | Review code quality, run quality gates, commit (per story) |

## Available Agents

### 1. Intake Agent

**File:** [intake-agent.md](intake-agent.md)

**Purpose:** First agent in the INTAKE phase. The orchestrator welcomes the user and routes between "share docs" (Option A), "prototype import" (Option B), or "guided Q&A" (Option C) paths before invoking this agent. Scans `documentation/`, gathers project basics via a checklist, and produces the intake manifest.

**When to use:**
- Always runs first when starting a new feature via `/start`
- Automatically invoked by the orchestrator

**Operating modes (auto-detected):**
- **Mode 1 — Existing specs:** Summarizes findings from `documentation/`, quick confirmation
- **Mode 2 — Partial information:** Identifies what exists, flags gaps, asks checklist questions
- **Mode 3 — Starting from scratch:** User provided a project description via guided Q&A (Option C); checklist questions asked with that context

**Key outputs:**
- `generated-docs/context/intake-manifest.json`

---

### 2. Intake BRD Review Agent

**File:** [intake-brd-review-agent.md](intake-brd-review-agent.md)

**Purpose:** Reviews requirements for completeness against the FRS template, asks clarifying questions, and produces the canonical Feature Requirements Specification. Second agent in the INTAKE phase.

**When to use:**
- Runs after intake-agent completes
- Automatically invoked by the orchestrator

**Operating modes (auto-detected):**
- **Mode A — BRD/spec exists:** Reviews against FRS template, asks targeted clarifying questions
- **Mode B — No BRD/spec:** Walks user through full requirements conversation guided by template sections

**Key outputs:**
- `generated-docs/specs/feature-requirements.md`
- `generated-docs/context/intake-manifest.json` (amendments)

---

### 3. Design API Agent

**File:** [design-api-agent.md](design-api-agent.md)

**Purpose:** Designs a complete OpenAPI specification from the Feature Requirements Specification. Analyzes functional requirements and data model to identify needed endpoints.

**When to use:**
- Runs during DESIGN phase when `manifest.artifacts.apiSpec.generate == true`
- When the feature requires API endpoints and no spec exists

**Key outputs:**
- `generated-docs/specs/api-spec.yaml`

---

### 3b. Design Style Agent

**File:** [design-style-agent.md](design-style-agent.md)

**Purpose:** Formalizes styling and branding requirements into CSS design tokens (`:root`/`.dark` overrides in oklch) and a style reference guide for guidance CSS cannot express (typography, spacing, component selection, layout, motion, accessibility).

**When to use:**
- Runs during DESIGN phase when `manifest.artifacts.designTokensCss.generate == true` or `manifest.artifacts.designTokensMd.generate == true`
- When the feature has branding or styling requirements

**Key outputs:**
- `generated-docs/specs/design-tokens.css`
- `generated-docs/specs/design-tokens.md`

---

### 3c. Design Wireframe Agent

**File:** [design-wireframe-agent.md](design-wireframe-agent.md)

**Purpose:** Generates simple text-based wireframes from the Feature Requirements Specification. Creates ASCII/markdown layouts for each screen before story planning begins. References user-provided wireframes and the generated API spec when available.

**When to use:**
- Runs during DESIGN phase when `manifest.artifacts.wireframes.generate == true`
- When the feature involves UI components

**Key outputs:**
- `generated-docs/specs/wireframes/_overview.md`
- `generated-docs/specs/wireframes/screen-N-[name].md`

---

### 4. Feature Planner

**File:** [feature-planner.md](feature-planner.md)

**Purpose:** Transforms feature specifications into structured implementation plans through collaborative refinement. Creates epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria. Automatically references wireframes if available.

**When to use:**
- Starting a new feature from a specification
- Breaking down complex requirements into implementable stories
- After INTAKE and DESIGN phases complete

**Invocation:**
```
Plan the user authentication feature based on the spec
```

**Key outputs:**
- `generated-docs/stories/_feature-overview.md`
- `generated-docs/stories/epic-N-[name]/story-N-[name].md`

---

### 5. Test Generator

**File:** [test-generator.md](test-generator.md)

**Purpose:** Generates comprehensive Vitest + React Testing Library tests BEFORE implementation. Creates failing tests that define acceptance criteria as executable code.

**When to use:**
- Immediately after feature-planner completes an epic
- Before ANY implementation code is written
- When defining what a component/feature should do

**Invocation:**
```
Generate tests for Epic 1: Basic Auth
```

**Key outputs:**
- `web/src/__tests__/integration/[feature].test.tsx`

---

### 6. Developer

**File:** [developer.md](developer.md)

**Purpose:** Implements user stories from project plans one at a time, ensuring each story is properly completed and reviewed before moving to the next. Follows a main branch workflow with review gates.

**When to use:**
- After test-generator has created failing tests (ready for IMPLEMENT phase)
- When implementing stories from a project plan
- When you want controlled, incremental feature implementation with review checkpoints

**Invocation:**
```
Implement the next story from the plan
```
or
```
Start implementing the user authentication stories
```

**Key behaviors:**
- Implements exactly ONE story at a time
- Locates and makes failing tests pass
- Runs all 4 quality gates before transitioning to QA
- Follows project patterns (App Router, Shadcn UI, API client)

---

### 7. Code Reviewer

**File:** [code-reviewer.md](code-reviewer.md)

**Purpose:** Reviews code changes for quality, security, and adherence to project patterns. Prompts user for manual verification in the web app. Routes issues by severity for resolution.

**When to use:**
- After implementing a feature (IMPLEMENT phase complete)
- Before creating a PR
- As part of the QA phase

**Invocation:**
```
Review the code changes for the portfolio dashboard
```

**What it checks:**
- TypeScript & React quality
- Next.js 16 patterns
- Security (XSS, secrets, RBAC)
- Project patterns (API client, types, Shadcn UI)
- Testing coverage
- Accessibility
- Manual verification (user tests in browser)

**Issue resolution:**
- Critical issues → pause, user fixes (with optional Claude assistance), re-review
- High/Medium issues → logged for fix epic (via REALIGN)

## Workflow Recommendations

### Starting a New Feature

1. **INTAKE (Mandatory):** Orchestrator welcomes user and routes (share docs vs. guided Q&A), then runs intake-agent and intake-brd-review-agent via scoped calls
   - Onboarding: welcome message → routing question → (Option A: user adds docs / Option B: prototype import / Option C: project description prompt)
   - Each agent uses 3 scoped calls: analyze → orchestrator asks questions → produce artifact → orchestrator approves → finalize
   - Orchestrator handles all user interaction via AskUserQuestion (with free-text exception for project description)
   - Approve manifest → approve FRS → **mandatory /clear + /continue**

2. **DESIGN (Mandatory, multi-agent):** Orchestrator reads intake manifest, invokes agents conditionally (API → Style → Wireframe) via scoped calls
   - Each agent: produce artifact → orchestrator approves → commit/revise
   - Wireframe agent has 3 calls (screen list → wireframes → commit)
   - **mandatory /clear + /continue** after all DESIGN agents complete

3. **SCOPE:** Invoke `feature-planner` via 2 scoped calls
   - Call A: propose epics → orchestrator approves → Call B: write + commit
   - **mandatory /clear + /continue**

4. **STORIES:** Invoke `feature-planner` via 2 scoped calls
   - Call A: propose stories → orchestrator approves → Call B: write + commit
   - Proceeds directly to REALIGN

5. **Per-story cycle:** REALIGN → WRITE-TESTS → IMPLEMENT → QA
   - All phases use scoped calls; orchestrator handles user interaction between calls
   - IMPLEMENT: 2 developer calls (implement, then quality gates)
   - QA: 3 code-reviewer calls (review, gates + checklist, commit) with orchestrator manual verification
   - After QA manual verification → **mandatory /clear + /continue**

6. **Epic completion:** After last story's QA, code-reviewer presents epic review
   - **Mandatory /clear + /continue** before starting next epic

7. **Repeat:** Next epic's STORIES phase, or feature complete

### Context Management

Context clearing happens at 5 mandatory boundaries (INTAKE approval, DESIGN complete, epic list approval, story QA completion, epic completion). Between these boundaries, phases transition automatically. A post-compaction hook (`inject-phase-context.ps1`) restores workflow instructions if auto-compaction fires mid-workflow.

### Quick Quality Check

Before committing:
```
/quality-check
```

### Reviewing Existing Code

For code review without full TDD workflow:
```
Review the authentication module for security issues
```

## Context Directory

The `generated-docs/context/` directory is used for agent-to-agent communication. Files here are temporary and gitignored.

| File | Created By | Used By |
|------|------------|---------|
| `intake-manifest.json` | intake-agent (created), intake-brd-review-agent (amended) | DESIGN orchestrator, feature-planner |
| `workflow-state.json` | transition scripts | all agents |
| `review-findings.json` | code-reviewer | code-reviewer (QA phase) |
| `quality-gate-status.json` | code-reviewer | (final output) |

---

## Workflow State Management

### Transition Scripts

The workflow uses scripts to track and validate state:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `transition-phase.js` | Manages phase transitions with validation |
| `validate-phase-output.js` | Validates artifacts exist for a phase |
| `detect-workflow-state.js` | Detects state from artifacts (read-only) |

### Script Execution Verification (CRITICAL)

**Agents MUST verify script execution succeeded before proceeding.**

When running transition scripts, always check the JSON output:

```bash
# Run the transition
node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --current --to WRITE-TESTS

# Expected success output:
# { "status": "ok", "message": "Transitioned Epic 1 from PLAN to WRITE-TESTS", ... }

# Error output (DO NOT PROCEED):
# { "status": "error", "message": "Invalid transition...", ... }
```

**Verification rules:**
1. `"status": "ok"` = Success, proceed to next step
2. `"status": "error"` = **STOP** and report the error to the user
3. `"status": "warning"` = Proceed with caution, inform user of the warning

### Validation Flags

Use these flags for additional safety:

```bash
# Check prerequisites before transitioning
node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --epic 1 --to WRITE-TESTS --validate

# Verify the FROM phase created expected outputs
node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --current --to IMPLEMENT --verify-output
```

### Repair Function

If workflow state is lost or corrupted:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/transition-phase.js --repair
```

The repair function provides a **confidence level** (high/medium/low):
- **High confidence:** Artifacts clearly indicate state
- **Medium confidence:** Some assumptions made - verify with user
- **Low confidence:** Many assumptions - require user confirmation before proceeding

## Creating Custom Agents

Use the template file [_agent-template.md](_agent-template.md) to create new agents.

Key requirements:
1. Add YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `model`, and `tools`
2. Document clear purpose and when to use
3. Define step-by-step workflow
4. Include DO/DON'T guidelines
5. Provide example prompts
